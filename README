  Vector Zoetrope
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zoetropes are an old, but charming way to display animations, invented long
before film projection was invented. This project is a vector animation player
which fits in 512 bytes on a GD32VF103 RISC-V microcontroller, using two DAC
channels for vector graphics on an analog oscilloscope in XY mode connected to

   GND and the two DAC channels on pins
   PA4 (horizontal) and
   PA5 (vertical).

  Design ideas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animation data that consists of the elements

  moveto x y
  lineto x y
  end_of_frame
  end_of_animation

with x and y between 0 and 4095 for 12 bit DACs is displayed. Lines are rendered
with the well known Bresenham algorithm, and the pixels are feed into a ring
buffer that is processed by an interrupt handler for a constant pixel clock
of 2.25 MHz in order to keep uniform brightness regardless of the calculation
time necessary for an individual pixel.

If coordinate delta is within (-64..63, -64..63), lineto elements are encoded
in 16 bits of data, all other elements are encoded in 32 bits of data.

More sophisticated data representation for longer animations is coming soon!

  How to run:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have connected your

Longan Nano board to
             a USB-serial cable with 3.3V logic levels

3V3 or 5V -- VCC (measure the voltage present here)
R0        -- TXD
T0        -- RXD
GND       -- GND

you can flash it if you first

* Press and hold BOOT0 button
* Press and release Reset button
* Release BOOT0 button

and then execute

stm32loader -e -w -v -p /dev/ttyUSB0 vector-zoetrope.bin

on your host machine.

Press and release Reset button to start animation.
